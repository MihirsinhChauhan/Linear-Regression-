# Linear-Regression-

Linear regression performs a regression task on a target variable based on independent variables in a given data. It is a machine learning algorithm and is often used to find the relationship between the target and independent variables.

The __Simple Linear Regression model__ is to predict the target variable using one independent variable.

When one variable/column in a dataset is not sufficient to create a good model and make more accurate predictions, we’ll use a multiple linear regression model instead of a simple linear regression model

The line equation for the multiple linear regression model is:
```y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + ....+ βpXp + e```
